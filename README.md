### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alan. I'm a software developer currently working as a data engineer, with experience ranging from engineering ETL pipelines and data science to web development. I'm always learning and am hyper-focused on building skills in web development because I think it's wicked cool. My job has me writing Python daily and I write JavaScript with TypeScript for fun and practice in my free time.
