### Hi there 👋

I'm Alan. I write cool software 🧑‍💻 

I currently work on data platforms, writing Python and working with technologies like Airflow, DBT, and Snowflake to build data warehouses and ELT pipelines. I also write software for the web with Typescript. You'll find a range of personal projects in my repo ranging from data analysis to fun web apps. 

In my free time I love spending time outdoors, hiking or camping with my wife, traveling to new countries, tinkering with tech at home, or bouldering. In a past life, I performed computational paleoclimate research, and spreading awareness of the reality and threat of climate change are deeply important to me. 

I love open source and I am a persistent lifelong learner who finds the breakneck pace of innovation in tech to be thrilling. AI might take all of our jobs soon but I'm going to have fun making 🍝 until then.
